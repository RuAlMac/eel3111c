# EEL3111C
This repo contains the libraries I've created for the TI-NSpire for EEL3111C exams.

**For Exam 2** _updated 10/28 @ 3:10_<br>
I've started writing the library for Exam 2. So far, I've written one giant function for help with questions about natural/step response of parallel/series RLC circuits. Feel free to look it over and suggest changes if you spot something off!

If you think there's a function that would be helpful for this library, feel more than free to start a pull request with your added function!
